## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
cancer_all <- read_csv("data/opendata_inc1620comb_hb (1).csv")
```

```{r}
theme_mhairi <-
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 8),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),
    complete = TRUE,
    legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r}
cancer_all <- clean_names(cancer_all)
```
```{r}
cancer_all(head(view al))
```



### Introduction

- The data used is from PHS (Public Health Scotland) and in order to provide an over view of the data I have used the following data set:
2016 - 2021 - Five Year Incidence of Cancer by Health Board


### Purpose of the Data Review

In order to inform current and future planning for provision of cancer treatment services in NHS Borders, you would like to gain a better understanding of the incidence of cancer in NHS Borders.


###Overview of Trends in Cancer in NHS Borders
```{r}
cancer_allBorders <-cancer_all %>%
  filter(hb == "S08000016")
```
```{r}
gender_count <-cancer_allBorders%>% 
  select(sex)%>%
  count(sex)
```


```{r}
cancer_allBorders %>%
  filter(cancer_site == "All cancer types") %>%
  filter(sex != "All") %>%
 ggplot +
  aes(x = year, y = incidences_all_ages, colour = sex) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    title = "All cancer cases in Borders",
    subtitle =  "2016 to 2022",
    y = "incidence")
```




```{r,fig.height=2}
plot_left <- 
cancer_allBorders %>%
  filter(cancer_site == "All cancer types") %>%
  filter(sex != "All") %>%
 ggplot +
  aes(x = year, y = incidences_all_ages, colour = sex) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    title = "All cancer cases in Borders",
    subtitle =  "2016 to 2022",
    y = ""
  ) +
  theme_mhairi
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
